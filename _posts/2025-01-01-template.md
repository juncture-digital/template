**Monument Valley**, meaning "*valley of the rocks*", is a region of the Colorado Plateau characterized by a cluster of sandstone buttes, with the largest reaching 1,000 ft above the valley floor. The most famous butte formations are located in northeastern Arizona along the Utahâ€“Arizona state line. The valley is considered sacred by the Navajo Nation, the Native American people within whose reservation it lies.
