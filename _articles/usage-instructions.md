## Adding a new article

1. Select and copy article template text from [_articles/template/index.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juncture-digital/template/main/_articles/template/index.md)

2. In the [_articles](_articles) folder, select `Add file` > `+ Create new file` from the menu located in the top right section of the page.

  - Name a name for the new article using the input area with `Name your file...` placeholder.  The file name should be a short name for the article (using lowercase text, numbers and hyphens) followed by `/index.md`.  For example, `monument-valley/index.md`
  - Paste the article template text into the input area with `Enter file contents here` placeholder.  The pasted text contains the front matter for the article.  The article front matter is used for indexing and display.
  - Update the front matter fields:
    - **title**: 
    - **description**: 
    - **author**: 
    - **date**: Publish date in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`
    - **tags**: Optional tags for categorizing the article.  Multiple tags are space separated.  Refer to the [Adding a new tag](#adding-a-new-tag) section for information on how new tags are added. 
    - **thumbnail**: 
    - **permalink**: 
    - **published**: This is set to `false` initially.  When the value is false the article will not appear in the article index.
